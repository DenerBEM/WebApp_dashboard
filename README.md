### :muscle: Motivation for the project:
My motivation for this project was to gain more experience in software engineering and write a modular and clean code. I tried to apply the good practices in my codes, writing comments and docstrings and needed. I already was familiarized with the wrangle part of the code, but the web development, the python modules, and mainly the deployement part, were the first time for me.

### :boy: Author:
My name is Dener, I'm 25 years old, and I've studied Data Science since December 2019, and I've been putting my knowledge in practice by doing some personal projects and publish them on GitHub.
I hope you enjoy reading my codes.
